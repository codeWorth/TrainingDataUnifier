#gameData = createTrainingData.loadSavedTrainingData("exampleSavedTrainingData.pbz2")


#uncomment below code and replace dummy arg with the path to a valid previously saved training data file. Run to see frame data format

# gameData = createTrainingData.loadSavedTrainingData("insert valid path to saved training data")
# print(f"This variable contains data for {len(gameData)} game frames in addition to controller input data")
